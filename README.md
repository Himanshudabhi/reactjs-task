# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



# React + Vite Application

## Project Setup and Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshudabhi/reactjs-task.git
   cd reactjs-task
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 18 or higher is recommended).
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   To start the application in development mode with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
4. **Build for Production**:
   To build the application for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview the Production Build**:
   You can preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

6. **Lint the Code**:
   Run ESLint to check for code quality and adhere to best practices:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

## Features

### 1. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**
   - Powered by Vite for instant feedback during development.

### 2. **ESLint Integration**
   - Configured with recommended rules for JavaScript and React to maintain code quality.

### 3. **Material-UI (MUI) Integration**
   - Modern UI components using MUI for consistent design.

### 4. **State Management**
   - Uses `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux` for efficient and scalable state management.

### 5. **Routing**
   - Implements `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.

### 6. **Styling**
   - Supports `styled-components` and `@emotion` for dynamic and reusable styling solutions.

### 7. **Mock API Support**
   - Integration with [MockAPI.io](https://mockapi.io/) for testing API integration during development.

## Instructions for Running the Mock API

1. **Set Up MockAPI**:
   - Create an account on [MockAPI.io](https://mockapi.io/) if you don’t have one.
   - Create a new project and define your API resources (e.g., `users`, `posts`, etc.).

2. **Access the Mock API**:
   - Retrieve the base URL for your MockAPI project (e.g., `https://<project_id>.mockapi.io`).

3. **Update API Base URL**:
   - Ensure your API service files point to the MockAPI base URL:
   ```javascript
   const BASE_URL = 'https://<project_id>.mockapi.io';
   ```

4. **Use the API**:
   - Implement CRUD operations using Axios or Fetch in your `services` directory. For example:
   ```javascript
   import axios from 'axios';

   const BASE_URL = 'https://<project_id>.mockapi.io';

   export const getUsers = async () => {
     const response = await axios.get(`${BASE_URL}/users`);
     return response.data;
   };
   ```

## Design Choices and Notes

### Why Vite?
   - **Performance**: Vite provides a fast and lightweight development environment.
   - **Modern Tooling**: Offers a modern build chain with support for ES Modules and advanced optimization.

### Component-Driven Design
   - The application follows a **component-driven architecture** to ensure reusability and maintainability.

### State Management
   - **Redux Toolkit** was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in managing global state.

### Styling
   - **MUI** and **styled-components** are used to ensure a consistent and modern design system.

### ESLint Configuration
   - ESLint is set up to follow best practices and enforce consistent coding standards.

## Additional Notes

- The project is configured to ignore the `dist` directory in both `.gitignore` and ESLint settings to avoid unnecessary clutter and ensure clean builds.
- Future improvements include adding testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
